Description: Implementation for sparse logistic functional principal component analysis (SLFPCA). SLFPCA is specifically developed for functional binary data, and the estimated eigenfunction can be strictly zero on some sub-intervals, which is helpful for interpretation. The crucial function of this package is SLFPCA().
